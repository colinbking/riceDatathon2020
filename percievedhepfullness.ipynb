Additionally, lectures were fast-paced to an absurd degree.  I am pretty sure Tour himself knew at times that there was no possible way we could actually be absorbing everything he was trying to teach because of the speed he was going at.  Class is essentially a complete rehash of exactly what's in the textbook, which made attending even more pointless - instead of trying teach each lecture at a pace we can't follow anyway, how about using the time more productively and teaching us to apply the concepts perhaps?  Homework consisted of a HUGE amount (40-50 for each of the 14 chapters) of \"optional\" problems from the textbook and you'd at least need to do a good majority of them to get a handle on the material, and a fair amount of each exam consists of these homework problems, too.  Tour does not curve for As, so you actually need a raw 90% to get an A-, and unlike gen chem (which was also uncurved), you don't have extra credit participation points / redemption points to fall back on, so obtaining an A-/A in this class is an insane feat and much harder than in orgo classes with other teachers, which is kinda unfair.  If you want to do well, you will need to spend an immense amount of time on this class - I usually could never go a single day without doing some sort of orgo work or else I'd fall behind.  If you are able to organize yourself very well and really be on top of things in this class, you will be able to do well.  Just don't fall behind or you're screwed.</td>\n",

In theory Professor Tour makes the class really easy by putting lots of previously seen questions on all of the exams. However, since he doesn't really teach and you have to learn the concepts on your own, the exams are still very difficult. The lectures are literally just him reading the powerpoint that the author of the textbook made and so you don't learn anything from them. I found I did better when I didn't waste time going to lecture and just focused on reading the chapters myself and trying to teach myself the material.</td>\n",

I think most of my problems with the course stemmed from Dr. Tour, frankly. Orgo is definitely an interesting subject, but the way in which it was taught/assessed this semester encouraged busywork over understanding. When 50% of your exams are derived from recycled material (a la book questions), you're assigning equal weight to busywork and actual understanding of the material. While one could certainly argue that the busywork leads to understanding, I really disliked the fact that the exams were formatted in this manner. I think it detracted immensely from the way that I personally approached the course--it was not a question of how well you could do on the exams as much as it was \"how many book answers did you remember today?\" \\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, this class is a B trap. Tour's refusal to curve the A is fair, but it ends in many students giving up on doing their best to learn the material. Many people were simply apathetic by the end, as anything below a 90 resulted in a B, with a very, very wide range. At the very least, Gen Chem encouraged a greater level of understanding on the final exams through redemption points. Instead of this, Tour dropped the lowest exam grade, which ends up encouraging further apathy over understanding. Lecture was also quite useless. The idea of students learning outside a classroom doesn't excuse the ineffectual teaching within the classroom itself. I was incredibly disappointed by this course. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but Orgo 1 certainly failed spectacularly in meeting them. It's a shame. I think I would have discovered a greater passion for organic chemistry otherwise. I wish I had. I'm not really angry about the way this course went, I'm just quite sad. There's a lot of wasted potential here.</td>\n",

Tour is a great lecturer that makes you excited about the material he presents. Special topics at the end of class are great (and can affect you by half a letter grade on exams, so go to class!). Keep up with homework every week, because if you fall behind it's very hard to catch up. Online Sapling quizzes are stressful but overall informative.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe class is out of 500 points: 3 midterms (of increasing difficulty) worth 100 points each (lowest one dropped!!!!!), 20 points for discussion attendance, 80 points for Sapling quizzes, and a 200 point final. \\r\\nVery fair curve as well: To get an A in this class you need to earn a raw, uncurved A, but the B range extends from 70-89.

Additionally, lectures were fast-paced to an absurd degree.  I am pretty sure Tour himself knew at times that there was no possible way we could actually be absorbing everything he was trying to teach because of the speed he was going at.  Class is essentially a complete rehash of exactly what's in the textbook, which made attending even more pointless - instead of trying teach each lecture at a pace we can't follow anyway, how about using the time more productively and teaching us to apply the concepts perhaps?  Homework consisted of a HUGE amount (40-50 for each of the 14 chapters) of \"optional\" problems from the textbook and you'd at least need to do a good majority of them to get a handle on the material, and a fair amount of each exam consists of these homework problems, too.  Tour does not curve for As, so you actually need a raw 90% to get an A-, and unlike gen chem (which was also uncurved), you don't have extra credit participation points / redemption points to fall back on, so obtaining an A-/A in this class is an insane feat and much harder than in orgo classes with other teachers, which is kinda unfair.  If you want to do well, you will need to spend an immense amount of time on this class - I usually could never go a single day without doing some sort of orgo work or else I'd fall behind.  If you are able to organize yourself very well and really be on top of things in this class, you will be able to do well.  Just don't fall behind or you're screwed.   \n",

In theory Professor Tour makes the class really easy by putting lots of previously seen questions on all of the exams. However, since he doesn't really teach and you have to learn the concepts on your own, the exams are still very difficult. The lectures are literally just him reading the powerpoint that the author of the textbook made and so you don't learn anything from them. I found I did better when I didn't waste time going to lecture and just focused on reading the chapters myself and trying to teach myself the material.   \n",
       "15179  Orgo was a massive disappointment for me. While I recognize that what I write has no impact on anything, I'm required to write one of these anyway. I think most of my problems with the course stemmed from Dr. Tour, frankly. Orgo is definitely an interesting subject, but the way in which it was taught/assessed this semester encouraged busywork over understanding. When 50% of your exams are derived from recycled material (a la book questions), you're assigning equal weight to busywork and actual understanding of the material. While one could certainly argue that the busywork leads to understanding, I really disliked the fact that the exams were formatted in this manner. I think it detracted immensely from the way that I personally approached the course--it was not a question of how well you could do on the exams as much as it was \"how many book answers did you remember today?\" \\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, this class is a B trap. Tour's refusal to curve the A is fair, but it ends in many students giving up on doing their best to learn the material. Many people were simply apathetic by the end, as anything below a 90 resulted in a B, with a very, very wide range. At the very least, Gen Chem encouraged a greater level of understanding on the final exams through redemption points. Instead of this, Tour dropped the lowest exam grade, which ends up encouraging further apathy over understanding. Lecture was also quite useless. The idea of students learning outside a classroom doesn't excuse the ineffectual teaching within the classroom itself. I was incredibly disappointed by this course. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but Orgo 1 certainly failed spectacularly in meeting them. It's a shame. I think I would have discovered a greater passion for organic chemistry otherwise. I wish I had. I'm not really angry about the way this course went, I'm just quite sad. There's a lot of wasted potential here.   \n",

I'm infinitely lucky I had the opportunity to take Orgo I with Tour rather than any other teacher. It's definitely a lot: nothing about organic chemistry is intrinsically hard, it's just the sheer volume of information that gets overwhelming and makes it difficult to juggle. Tour is a great lecturer that makes you excited about the material he presents. Special topics at the end of class are great (and can affect you by half a letter grade on exams, so go to class!). Keep up with homework every week, because if you fall behind it's very hard to catch up. Online Sapling quizzes are stressful but overall informative.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe class is out of 500 points: 3 midterms (of increasing difficulty) worth 100 points each (lowest one dropped!!!!!), 20 points for discussion attendance, 80 points for Sapling quizzes, and a 200 point final. \\r\\nVery fair curve as well: To get an A in this class you need to earn a raw, uncurved A, but the B range extends from 70-89. So, it's very hard to get an A, but with decent effort you're almost handed a B.   \n",

We cover about a chapter a week. There was no homework that was due but there were suggested problems posted for every chapter. The suggested problems covered about 75% of all the questions in each chapter. Basically, the idea of this class was learn the first 14 chapters of the textbook and do all the problems. This class required a lot of time outside of class. In my opinion, lecture was not helpful. There was too much material presented way too fast. It was way too hard to keep pace. Plus, the lecture was just basically presenting the powerpoint slides. You can understand just as much by looking at the slides and reading the textbook at your own pace.   \n",

       "      <td>This course is extremely difficult. Orgo is a difficult subject already, but the way it was taught this semester made it even more difficult. We had 4 quizzes, 3 midterms, and a final this semester, along with weekly assignments on sapling, which is actually helpful. The class format was lecture slides that he often went through too fast for me to take notes or even understand, even though I always did the textbook reading and took detailed notes beforehand. Reading the textbook was basically useless as nothing in the class was really based on it. The lecture slides have so much material but are extremely confusing as they don't have very many words on them, just mechanisms, and since he doesn't write them out on the board step by step, seeing the packed slides all at once is overwhelming. Most of the lecture slides had lots and lots of practice problems at the end (sometimes almost 100 per lecture) that we were supposed to do for practice. While these problems were helpful, Dr. Kurti often refused to post the answer keys to these problems for several days, even until the night before the midterm because he blamed our poor grades on us giving up and using the key too easily. However, we need to key to check as we go and learn from our mistakes because I do not want to spend hours and hours doing 600 problems and then realize I did half of them wrong the day before the exam. The quizzes he writes are challenging but doable; however, his exams are unreasonably difficult and reflect no practice problems that we have ever seen in lecture slides, discussion, sapling, or the textbook (I used to do every single problem we had access to and was still often unable to answer entire questions on the exams).</td>\n",

You *have to* put in the time and effort in order to see results. Sapling is kinda annoying at first but you get used to it. There are 3 midterms, 4 in class quizzes, weekly homework assignments and 1 final, so there's plenty of opportunity to redeem yourself if you do screw up somewhere. There's also plenty of opportunities to earn bonus points in tests and in lectures. Some may say that in class bonus points promote competition between students but that's not the point.

       "16313  This course is extremely difficult. Orgo is a difficult subject already, but the way it was taught this semester made it even more difficult. We had 4 quizzes, 3 midterms, and a final this semester, along with weekly assignments on sapling, which is actually helpful. The class format was lecture slides that he often went through too fast for me to take notes or even understand, even though I always did the textbook reading and took detailed notes beforehand. Reading the textbook was basically useless as nothing in the class was really based on it. The lecture slides have so much material but are extremely confusing as they don't have very many words on them, just mechanisms, and since he doesn't write them out on the board step by step, seeing the packed slides all at once is overwhelming. Most of the lecture slides had lots and lots of practice problems at the end (sometimes almost 100 per lecture) that we were supposed to do for practice.
