The homework and the exams of this course are mostly multiple choices or \"fill in the blank\" type of problems,  which is fine for an introductory course.

I do wish it was a little bit more challenging to do well, though, as I found that I did not learn as much as I wish I had just because I put it at the bottom of my priority list and still should get an A. If the assignments had more so required that you actually know the material I think I would be really happy with my learnings.   \n",

Some of the things you learn in it are quite helpful and interesting. The lecturers are not very engaging, and some of the slides are very confusing to read.

Despite all of this this, Dr. Simar is very nice and passionate about the material, and everyone likes him.   \n",

Additionally, the sheer number of students compared to TAs in this course contributes to a desire in labs to just get an answer and move on. Lectures don't really align with labs/projects and there is a steep learning curve for those that have never programmed before.   \n",

The material covered in class usually was not the same as the content addressed in the textbook, so at times I felt confused in class.  I thought that the bi-weekly discussion sessions were not very helpful; lectures would have been more effective.  However the recitation sessions were an excellent resource.   \n",

The material is very interesting; however, it could be presented in a more rigorous way that requires students to apply themselves and go to class.   \n",

New content was added this semester. We only had one attempt at homework/exams. For a few weeks, we had an in-class quiz every lecture.   \n",
